# CPRG-216-C - Group 14 Lab 3 -Loops
Use Python IDE to create a solution for the scenario presented in each question.
## 1.	Average of integers
Write a program that gets an integer N > 1 from the user and computes the average of all integers I = 1, … , N. The computation should be done in a function that takes N as input parameter. Print the result to the screen with an appropriate text. Run the program with N=5 and confirm that you get the correct answer.
## 2.	A while loop with errors
Assume a program has been written for the task of adding all integers I = 1, 2, ...10: 
Some_number = 0
i = 1
While i < 11
	Some_number += 1
Print some_number
a.	Identify the errors in the program by only reading the code.
b.	Write a new version of the program with the errors corrected. Run this program and confirm that it gives the correct output.
